Scenario:

You're developing a critical system for a hospital's patient monitoring unit. This system continuously collects vital sign data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) from sensors attached to patients and displays it on a central monitor for healthcare professionals. It's crucial to ensure robust error handling to prevent potential issues from disrupting patient care.

Potential Exceptions and Handling:

1. Sensor Malfunction:
   - Exception Type: 'SensorDataException' (custom class inheriting from 'std::runtime_error')
   - 'try...catch' Block:
     - In the code that reads sensor data, wrap the reading operation in a 'try' block.
     - Within a 'catch (const SensorDataException& e)' block, handle the exception by:
       - Logging the error message (e.what()) for troubleshooting.
       - Displaying a user-friendly error message on the monitor, indicating which sensor is malfunctioning and suggesting corrective actions (e.g., "Sensor X is temporarily unavailable. Please check connection or replace sensor").
       - Consider using a fallback value (e.g., last valid reading) for display purposes, but clearly indicate it's an estimate to avoid misleading healthcare professionals.

2. Invalid Data Format:
   - Exception Type: 'InvalidDataFormatException' (custom class inheriting from 'std::runtime_error')
   - 'try...catch' Block:
     - In the code that parses sensor data, wrap the parsing logic in a 'try' block.
     - Within a 'catch (const InvalidDataFormatException& e)' block, handle the exception by:
       - Logging the error message for debugging.
       - Displaying an informative message on the monitor ("Invalid data format received from sensor Y. Data integrity may be compromised. Investigating...").
       - Potentially attempt to recover or correct the data if possible (depending on the specific error).
       - If recovery is not feasible, consider using appropriate default values or initiating a sensor calibration routine.

3. Network Communication Failure:
   - Exception Type: 'NetworkException' (custom class inheriting from 'std::runtime_error') or a standard C++ networking exception class (if applicable)
   - 'try...catch' Block:
     - In the code that communicates with the sensors, wrap the network communication logic in a 'try' block.
     - Within a 'catch (const NetworkException& e)' block, handle the exception by:
       - Logging the error details.
       - Displaying a warning message on the monitor ("Network connection to sensors interrupted. Patient data may be delayed. Reconnecting...").
       - Implement retry logic for re-establishing the network connection as long as it's safe to do so without compromising time-sensitive data.
       - Consider storing received data locally while the network is down and transmitting it when the connection is restored.

Benefits of Exception Handling:

- Improved Code Maintainability: Isolates error handling logic, making code easier to read, understand, and modify.
- Enhanced Robustness: Prevents the program from crashing due to unexpected errors, ensuring the system remains operational for critical patient monitoring.
- Informative Error Messages: Provides healthcare professionals with clear error messages to aid in troubleshooting and maintaining patient safety.
- Graceful Fallbacks: Allows the system to gracefully handle errors by displaying appropriate messages, using fallback values, or attempting recovery processes.

By incorporating exception handling with well-defined custom exceptions, you can create a more reliable and informative patient monitoring system that effectively handles potential issues and safeguards patient care.
