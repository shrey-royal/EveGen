/*
iostream -> input output stream (istream + ostream)
istream -> input stream (cin)
ostream -> output stream (cout)

cout -> console output stream -> used to print the output
> cout uses insertion operator (<<) to print the output

cin -> console input stream -> used to take input from the user
> cin uses extraction operator (>>) to take input from the user

Difference between void main() and int main():

> void main() is not a standard way to write the main function
> int main() is a standard way to write the main function

> void main() is not returning any value
> int main() is returning 0 if program is successfully executed

> void main() is not taking any parameter
> int main() is taking two parameters (int argc, char* argv[])
